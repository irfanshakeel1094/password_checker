## Overview

Ever wondered if your password is strong enough?
This tool gives you a quick answer by analyzing your password based on some basic but important rules.

It's built using just Pythonâ€™s built-in librariesâ€”no extra installations needed.
It gives your password a strength rating so you can decide whether to keep it or strengthen it.

## What It Does

The checker looks for:

* âœ… Minimum length (at least 8 characters)
* ðŸ”  Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
* ðŸ”¢ Numbers
* ðŸ”£ Special characters like `@`, `!`, `#`, etc.

Once it checks all that, it gives your password a rating:
**WEAK**, **MODERATE**, or **STRONG**.

And for added privacy, it hides your password input using Pythonâ€™s `getpass` moduleâ€”so no one sees what you're typing!
